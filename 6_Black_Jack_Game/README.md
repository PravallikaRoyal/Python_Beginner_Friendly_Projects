Blackjack (21) 🃏💰
Welcome to the classic casino game of Blackjack, implemented right in your terminal! Pit your skills against the computer to try and hit that perfect score of 21.

Rules and Features ✨:
The game follows standard Blackjack rules with several key features implemented:
1. Initial Deal: Both the user and the computer receive two cards.
2. Hidden Hand: Only the computer's first card is revealed initially.
3. Blackjack Check:
    A score of 0 is used to represent a Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card, totaling 21).
4. Ace Handling: The Ace (value 11) intelligently changes its value to 1 if the total score exceeds 21, preventing an automatic bust.
5. Computer AI (Dealer Rules): The computer will continue to "hit" (take cards) until its score is 17 or higher.
6. Game Loop: The game automatically loops, allowing you to play multiple rounds without restarting the program.

Technologies Used 💻:
1. Python: The core language for game logic and command-line interface.
2. random Module: Used for randomly drawing cards.
3. art Module: (Assumed) Used to display a starting logo or game art.

Happy coding and good luck hitting 21! 🍀
