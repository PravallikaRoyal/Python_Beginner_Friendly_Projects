Blind Auction 🤫💰
Welcome to the Blind Auction! This is a simple, command-line implementation of a classic auction format where all bids are hidden until the very end. Test your resolve and see if your secret bid can win the prize!

Rules of the Game 📜:
Secret Bids: Each bidder enters their bid amount without knowing what others have offered.

Blind Process: The screen is cleared after each bid to maintain anonymity (in a real-world scenario, this is done by submitting written slips).

The Winner: Once all bids are in, the program reveals the single highest bidder and the winning amount! 👑

That's a fun project! The Blind Auction is a great use case for basic Python data structures and loops.

Here is a compelling README content for your Blind Auction project, using a similar engaging style with emojis:

How to Play ▶️
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd your-repo-name
Run the auction program:

Bash

python auction_main.py # Replace with your actual file name
Enter your name and your secret bid amount.

Clear the screen when prompted so the next bidder cannot see the previous bids! 🤫

The program will run until all bidders have placed their anonymous amounts.

Features ✨
Interactive Input: Simple and clear prompts for name and bid amount.

Blind System: Utilizes a screen-clearing mechanism (print("\n "* 20)) to hide previous bids, simulating the blind process.

Automatic Winner Selection: A dedicated function find_highest_bidder efficiently scans the dictionary of bids to declare the champion. 🥇

Dynamic Storage: Uses a Python Dictionary to store bidder names and their corresponding secret amounts.

Technologies Used 💻:
Python: The sole language used for the auction logic, input/output, and data management.
