Python Command-Line Calculator üßÆüêç
This is a simple, yet robust, command-line calculator built in Python. It features a persistent calculation mode, allowing you to use the result of the previous operation as the starting number for the next one, just like a real calculator!

Follow the prompts:
1. Enter your first number.
2. Pick an operation symbol (+, -, *, or /).
3. Enter your next number.
4. Choose to continue calculating with the result, or start a new calculation.

Features ‚ú®:
1. Four Basic Operations: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
2. Persistent Accumulation: You can continuously chain operations, where the answer of the last calculation automatically becomes the num1 for the next.
3. Function Mapping: Uses a Python Dictionary (operations) to map operation symbols to their respective Python functions, making the code clean and scalable.
4. Multi-Session: After completing a series of calculations, you can choose to start a completely new calculation session.

Code Structure Highlights üí°:
The project uses several key Python concepts:
1. Functions as Values: The operations dictionary stores function names as values, which allows the program to dynamically call the correct mathematical function based on the user's input symbol.
2. Recursion (for new sessions): The main calculator() function calls itself to restart the entire program after a user finishes a calculation chain.
3. While Loop Control: A while should_accumulate: loop manages the persistent calculation mode.

Technologies Used üíª:
Python: The core language for all logic and user interaction.

Contribution ü§ù:
Got ideas for improvement? You could enhance this project by:
1. Adding more advanced operations (e.g., exponentiation **).
2. Implementing error handling for division by zero.
3. Creating a single-session mode.
