Caesar Cipher Encoder/Decoder 🔒🔑
Welcome to the classic Caesar Cipher project! This simple, yet foundational, encryption tool allows you to secure messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet. It's a fun way to explore basic cryptography right from your command line!

How to Run the Cipher ▶️
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd your-repo-name
Execute the Python script:

Bash

python cipher.py # or the name of your main Python file
The program will prompt you to encode (encrypt) or decode (decrypt), enter your message, and specify the numeric shift value (key).

Features ✨:
1. Dual Functionality: Easily switch between encode to encrypt a message and decode to decrypt a secret one.
2. Alphabet Wrap-Around: The cipher correctly handles shifts that go past the letter 'z' (e.g., shifting 'z' by 3 results in 'c').
3. Non-Alphabetic Handling: Spaces, numbers, and punctuation are preserved, ensuring you can encrypt complex messages without losing formatting.
4. Interactive Loop: Use the program repeatedly without restarting, letting you encode and decode messages back-to-back. 🔁

Technologies Used 💻:
Python: The core language powering the simple and elegant cipher logic.

The Algorithm in Brief 🧠:
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

Encryption: (x + n) mod 26
Decryption: (x - n) mod 26

Where 'x' is the letter's position (0-25) and 'n' is the shift value.

Contribution 🤝:
This is a great starting point! If you'd like to contribute, consider adding features like:
1. Handling uppercase letters.
2. More robust shift value validation.
3. A user-friendly graphical interface (GUI).
