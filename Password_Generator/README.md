🔐 Password Generator

A simple Password Generator built with Python 🐍 that creates strong, random passwords based on user preferences.
The user can specify the number of letters (A–Z, a–z), numbers (0–9), and symbols (!, @, #, …) to include in the password.

✨ Features:
✅ Choose how many uppercase & lowercase letters to include
✅ Add any number of digits (0–9)
✅ Add special symbols for extra security
✅ Generates a random & secure password each time
✅ Easy-to-use and lightweight

⚙️ How It Works:
1. The program uses Python’s random module 🎲.
2. It creates lists of alphabets, numbers, and symbols.
3. Based on user input, it picks random characters from each category.
4. Finally, it shuffles the characters to generate a strong password

🎯 Future Improvements:
1. Add a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
2. Option to copy password to clipboard 📋
3. Password strength checker 🔎
